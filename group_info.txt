4) Reason for selecting problem :  

    Blogging is one of the best ways to share and gain knowledge.  

    So we decided to make a Blog Website, where multiple users can post there blog and also make groups.  

    Also this project will help us gain knowledge in the field of Web Dev. 

 

5) Current state of art to solve the problem :    

    There are many blogging websites online where you can see the blogs without logging in. 

    But some users want to share their blogs/posts with only the registered users or in groups.  

 

6) Your solution to problem : 

    We have used Django to make this website, where users can log in to see the blogs of other users. 

     Also we can create groups in it, which is an added advantage. 

     New users can create an account to register to the website. 

     Users can also delete or update their posts. 

     User information,blogs is stored in SQLite Database. 

     Styling of web app is done using CSS, Bootstrap. 

 

7) Tools and Technologies used  : 

        Python, 

        Django Framework, 

        SQLite Database, 

        HTML,  

        CSS,  

        Bootstrap. 

 

8)    Future Developments :-  

        We can create a recommendation system where blogs will be recommended to users 

        based on the content of blogs and user preferences. 

Currently  this website runs on local host, in future we can publish it.
